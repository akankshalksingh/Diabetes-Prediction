# Diabetes Prediction using demographic data and body measurements


#### **Objective**  
This project aims to develop a predictive model for diabetes using demographic data and body measurements derived from the **National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2013-2014 dataset**. The goal is to analyze various health and lifestyle factors to identify patterns and risk factors associated with diabetes.

#### **Data Source**  
The project utilizes publicly available data from **NHANES**, a program conducted by the **National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)** under the **Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)**. NHANES combines interviews, laboratory tests, and physical examinations to assess the health and nutritional status of a nationally representative sample of about 5,000 individuals each year.

#### **Key Data Components Used**
The dataset comprises multiple components, but this project primarily focuses on:
1. **Demographics Data:** Includes age, gender, ethnicity, education, income, and other socioeconomic factors.
2. **Examinations Data:** Contains physical health measurements such as blood pressure, BMI, and grip strength.
3. **Dietary Data:** Records daily nutrient intake, providing insights into dietary habits.
4. **Laboratory Data:** Includes critical biomarkers such as fasting glucose, glycohemoglobin (HbA1c), cholesterol levels, and insulin, which are essential for diagnosing diabetes.
5. **Questionnaire Data:** Covers self-reported health conditions, lifestyle habits, smoking, physical activity, and mental health factors.

#### **Methodology**
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, data normalization, and feature selection.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identifying correlations between features and diabetes prevalence.
- **Model Development:** Using machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict diabetes risk.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC curve to assess model performance.

#### **Expected Outcomes**
- Identification of key risk factors for diabetes based on demographic and body measurement data.
- A predictive model that helps in early detection and prevention of diabetes.
- Insights into potential interventions based on lifestyle, diet, and health behaviors.

This project leverages comprehensive NHANES data to create an effective and interpretable model for diabetes prediction, aiding in public health awareness and personalized healthcare recommendations.
